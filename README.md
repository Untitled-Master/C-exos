# 1. Sqrt(x)
Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
 

Example 1:

Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
Example 2:

Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.


# 9. Palindrome Number
Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
